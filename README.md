**About Libbitcoin**

The libbitcoin toolkit is a set of cross platform C++ libraries for building bitcoin applications. The toolkit consists of several libraries, most of which depend on the foundational [libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin) library. Each library's repository can be cloned and built using common [Automake](http://www.gnu.org/software/automake) instructions.

**About Libbitcoin Explorer**

BX is a command line tool for working with Bitcoin. It can be built as a single portable executable for Linux, OSX or Windows and is available for download as a signed single executable for each. BX exposes over 80 commands and supports network communication with [libbitcoin-server](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-server) or its predecessor [Obelisk](https://github.com/spesmilo/obelisk), and the P2P Bitcoin network. BX is well documented and supports simple and advanced scenarios, including stealth and multisig.

## Installation

BX can be built from sources or downloaded as a signed portable [single file executable](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/wiki/Download-BX).

On Linux and Macintosh BX is built using Autotools as follows and depends on [libbitcoin-client](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-client).

```sh
$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install # optional
$ sudo ldconfig     # optional
```

Detailed instructions are provided below.
* [Debian/Ubuntu](#debianubuntu)
* [Macintosh](#macintosh)
* [Windows](#windows)

### Debian/Ubuntu

Libbitcoin requires a C++11 compiler, currently minimum [GCC 4.8.0](https://gcc.gnu.org/projects/cxx0x.html) or Clang based on [LLVM 3.5](http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html).

To see your GCC version:
```sh
$ g++ --version
```
```
g++ (Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1) 4.8.2
Copyright (C) 2013 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```
If necessary, upgrade your compiler as follows:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install g++-4.8
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-4.8 50
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-4.8 50
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcov gcov /usr/bin/gcov-4.8 50
```
Next install the [build system](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) and git:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config git
```
Next install the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (minimum 1.56.0) development package:
```sh
$ sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
```
Next download the [install script](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/blob/version2/install.sh) and enable execution:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/version2/install.sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```
Finally install BX:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh
```
Bitcoin Explorer is now installed in `/usr/local/bin` and can be invoked as `$ bx`.

### Android

Android target is in experimental state and at the moment only arm64-v8a ABI is supported. Also, Android build works only on GNU/Linux hosts, such as Debian/Ubuntu.

To build BX for Android, you first need to install the same dependencies as for GNU/Linux build:

```sh
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake libtool pkg-config git
```

Then download CrystaX NDK build #886 (or higher) and unpack it:

```sh
$ curl -OL https://dl.crystax.net/builds/886/linux/crystax-ndk-10.3.1-b886-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
$ tar xf crystax-ndk-10.3.1-b886-linux-x86_64.tar.xz
$ mv crystax-ndk-10.3.1 crystax-ndk-10.3.1-b886
```

Now, just run `install.sh` with additional parameters:

```sh
$ ./install.sh --disable-shared --crystax-ndk=/path/to/the/unpacked/crystax-ndk-10.3.1-b886 --crystax-abis=arm64-v8a
```

When this script finish, you'll find new folder `android/arm64-v8a/bin`, containing `bx` executable as well as its dependencies (shared libraries).

Now plug your Android device by USB, ensure it's visible with `adb devices`, and deploy everything to Android:

```sh
$ adb shell mkdir -p /data/local/tmp/bx
$ for f in android/arm64-v8a/bin/*; do adb push $f /data/local/tmp/bx/; done
$ adb shell 'chmod 0755 /data/local/tmp/bx/*'
```

Now you can run `bx` command via adb shell:

```sh
$ adb shell 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp/bx /data/local/tmp/bx/bx help'
.....
$ adb shell 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/data/local/tmp/bx /data/local/tmp/bx/bx fetch-history 12cbQLTFMXRnSzktFkuoG3eHoMeFtpTu3S'
.....
```

### Macintosh

The OSX installation differs from Linux in the installation of the compiler and packaged dependencies. BX supports both [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) and [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org) package managers. Both require Apple's [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) command line tools. Neither requires Xcode as the tools may be installed independently.

BX compiles with Clang on OSX and requires C++11 support. Installation has been verified using Clang based on [LLVM 3.5](http://llvm.org/releases/3.5.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html). This version or newer should be installed as part of the Xcode command line tools.

To see your Clang/LLVM  version:
```sh
$ clang++ --version
```
```
Apple LLVM version 6.0 (clang-600.0.54) (based on LLVM 3.5svn)
Target: x86_64-apple-darwin14.0.0
Thread model: posix
```
If required update your version of the command line tools as follows:
```sh
$ xcode-select --install
```

#### Using Homebrew

First install Homebrew. Installation requires [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en) and [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se), which are pre-installed on OSX.
```sh
$ ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```
You may encounter a prompt to install the Xcode command line developer tools, in which case accept the prompt.

Next install the [build system](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) and [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget):
```sh
$ brew install autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig wget
```
Next install the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (1.56.0 or newer) development package:
```sh
$ brew install boost
```
Next download the [install script](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/blob/version2/install.sh) and enable execution:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/version2/install.sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```
Finally install BX:
```sh
$ ./install.sh
```
Bitcoin Explorer is now installed in `/usr/local/bin` and can be invoked as `$ bx`.

#### Using MacPorts

First install [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/install.php).

Next install the [build system](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system) and [wget](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget):
```sh
$ sudo port install autoconf automake libtool pkgconfig wget
```
Next install the [Boost](http://www.boost.org) (1.56.0 or newer) development package. The `-` options remove MacPort defaults that are not Boost defaults:
```sh
$ sudo port install boost -no_single -no_static -python27
```
Next download the [install script](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/blob/version2/install.sh) and enable execution:
```sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer/version2/install.sh
$ chmod +x install.sh
```
Finally install BX:
```sh
$ ./install.sh
```
Bitcoin Explorer is now installed in `/usr/local/bin` and can be invoked as `$ bx`.

### Configuration Options

Any set of `./configure` options can be passed via the build script, several examples follow.

Building for minimum size and with debug symbols stripped:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh CXXFLAGS=-Os --enable-ndebug
```
Building without building tests:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh --without-tests
```
Building from a specified directory, such as `/home/me/mybuild`:
```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh --build-dir=/home/me/mybuild
```
Building into a directory other than `/usr/local`, such as `/home/me/myprefix`:
```sh
$ ./install.sh --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```
Building and linking with a private copy of the Boost dependency:
```sh
$ ./install.sh --build-boost --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```
Building a statically-linked executable:
```sh
$ ./install.sh --disable-shared --build-boost --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```
Building a small statically-linked executable most quickly:
```sh
$ ./install.sh CXXFLAGS=-Os --enable-ndebug --without-tests --disable-shared --build-boost --prefix=/home/me/myprefix
```
Building with bash-completion support:

> If your target system does not have it pre-installed you must first install the [bash-completion](http://bash-completion.alioth.debian.org) package. Packages are available for common package managers, including apt-get, homebrew and macports.

```sh
$ sudo ./install.sh --with-bash-completion-dir
```

### Windows

Visual Studio solutions are maintained for all libbitcoin libraries and dependencies. The supported execution environment is `Windows XP Service Pack 2` and newer.

#### Upgrade Compiler

Libbitcoin requires a C++11 compiler, which means **Visual Studio 2013** minimum. Additionally a pre-release compiler must be installed as an update to Visual Studio. Download and install the following tools as necessary. Both are available free of charge:

* [Visual Studio 2013 Express](http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/visual-studio-express-vs.aspx)
* [November 2013 CTP Compiler](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41151)

#### Create Local NuGet Repository

Dependencies apart from the libbitcoin libraries are available as [NuGet packages](https://www.nuget.org/packages?q=evoskuil). The libbitcoin solution files are configured with references to these packages.

> To avoid redundancies and conflicts across libbitcoin repositories these references expect a [NuGet.config](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/release-notes/nuget-2.1) in a central location. Despite flexibility in locating NuGet.config, NuGet writes the individual package paths into project files. As such the central repository should be configured in the same relative location as indicated by these paths within the project files. See [NuGet Repository](#nuget-repository) below.

The required set of NuGet packages can be viewed using the [NuGet package manager](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/managing-nuget-packages-using-the-dialog) from the BX solution. The NuGet package manager will automatically download missing packages, either from the build scripts or after prompting you in the Visual Studio environment. For your reference these are the required packages:

* Packages maintained by [sergey.shandar](http://www.nuget.org/profiles/sergey.shandar)
   * [boost](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost)
   * [boost\_chrono-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_chrono-vc120)
   * [boost\_date\_time-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_date_time-vc120)
   * [boost\_filesystem-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_filesystem-vc120)
   * [boost\_iostreams-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_iostreams-vc120)
   * [boost\_program\_options-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_program_options-vc120)
   * [boost\_regex-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_regex-vc120)
   * [boost\_system-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_system-vc120)
   * [boost\_thread-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_thread-vc120)
   * [boost\_unit\_test\_framework-vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/boost_unit_test_framework-vc120)
* Packages maintained by [evoskuil](http://www.nuget.org/profiles/evoskuil)
   * [libzmq\_vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/libzmq_vc120)
   * [secp256k1\_vc120](http://www.nuget.org/packages/secp256k1_vc120)

#### Build Libbitcoin Projects

To build BX you must also download and build its **libbitcoin dependencies**, as these are not yet packaged. The builds can be performed manually (from within Visual Studio) or using the `buildall.bat` script provided in the `builds\msvc\build\` subdirectory of each repository. The scripts automatically download the required NuGet packages.

> Tip: The `buildall.bat` scripts build *all* valid configurations. The build time can be significantly reduced by disabling all but the desired configuration in the `buildbase.bat` of each project.

Build these solutions in order:

1. [libbitcoin/libbitcoin](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin)
2. [libbitcoin/libbitcoin-protocol](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-protocol)
2. [libbitcoin/libbitcoin-client](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-client)
3. [libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer](https://github.com/libbitcoin/libbitcoin-explorer)

> The libbitcoin dynamic (DLL) build configurations do not compile, as the exports have not yet been fully implemented. These are currently disabled in the build scripts but you will encounter numerous errors if you build then manually.

Configuration options are exposed in the Visual Studio property pages.

#### Optional: Build Everything

The non-boost packages above are all sourced from GitHub repositories maintained using the same [Visual Studio template](https://github.com/evoskuil/visual-studio-template) as the libbitcoin libraries. If so desired each of these can be built locally, in the same manner as the libbitcoin libraries above. This allows you to avoid using the pre-built NuGet packages. The repositories for each dependency are as follows:

* Cryptography
   * [libbitcoin/secp256k1](https://github.com/libbitcoin/secp256k1)
* Zero Message Queue
   * [zeromq/libzmq](https://github.com/zeromq/libzmq)

This change is properly accomplished by disabling the "NuGet Dependencies" in the Visual Studio properties user interface for each libbitcoin project and then importing the `.import.props` file(s) for the corresponding dependencies.

#### NuGet Repository
NuGet packages are downloaded to a local file systems repository. By default the [NuGet Package Manager](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/27077b70-9dad-4c64-adcf-c7cf6bc9970c) uses a repository path within the solution. This can complicate source control and results in multiple repositories across solutions.

A better configuration is to centralize the NuGet repository outside of your `git` directory, for example:

```
-me
    -git
        nuget.config
        -libbitcoin
        -libbitcoin-client
        -libbitcoin-explorer
            -builds
                -msvc
                    -vs2013
                        +bx
                        -libbitcoin-explorer
                            libbitcoin-explorer.vcxproj
                            packages.config
                        +libbitcoin-explorer-test
                        libbitcoin-explorer.sln
        -libbitcoin-protocol
    -nuget
        repositories.config
        +boost.1.56.0.0
        +boost_chrono-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +boost_date_time-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +boost_filesystem-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +boost_iostreams-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +boost_program_options-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +boost_regex-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +boost_system-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +boost_thread-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +boost_unit_test_framework-vc120.1.56.0.0
        +libzmq_vc120.4.2.2.0
        +secp256k1_vc120.0.1.0.13
```

If properly configured the NuGet Package Manager will share this NuGet repository across all solutions within the `git` directory. There are three steps required in this configuration:

* Create a `nuget` directory as a sibling to your `git` directory.
* Create a `nuget.config` file in the root of your `git` directory.
* Ensure there are no other `nuget.config` files in your `git` directory.

The `nuget.config` should have the [documented structure](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/nuget-config-settings) and should refer to the relative `nuget` directory `..\nuget` as follows:

```xml
<configuration>
  <config>
    <!-- Allows you to install the NuGet packages in the specified folder,
    instead of the default "$(Solutiondir)\Packages" folder. -->
    <add key="repositoryPath" value="..\nuget" />
  </config>
  <solution>
    <!-- Disable source control integration for the "Packages" folder. -->
    <add key="disableSourceControlIntegration" value="true" />
  </solution>
  <packageRestore>
    <!-- Allow NuGet to download missing packages -->
    <add key="enabled" value="false" />
    <!-- Automatically check for missing packages during build in Visual Studio -->
    <add key="automatic" value="false" />
  </packageRestore>
  <packageSources>
    <!-- Allows you to specify the list of sources to be used while looking for packages. -->
    <add key="NuGet official package source" value="https://nuget.org/api/v2/" />
  </packageSources>
  <disabledPackageSources>
    <!-- "DisabledPackageSources" has the list of sources which are currently disabled. -->
  </disabledPackageSources>
  <activePackageSource>
    <!-- "ActivePackageSource" points to the currently active source. 
    Specifying "(Aggregate source)" as the source value would imply that
    all the current package sources except for the disabled ones are active. -->
    <add key="All" value="(Aggregate source)"  />
  </activePackageSource>
  <packageSourceCredentials>
    <!-- Allows you to set the credentials to access the given package source. -->
    <!-- <feedName>
    <add key="Username" value="foobar" />
    <add key="ClearTextPassword" value="secret" />
    </feedName> -->
  </packageSourceCredentials>
</configuration>
```

With this configuration in place you should experience the following behavior. When you open one of these Visual Studio projects and then open the Package Manager, you may be informed that there are missing packages. Upon authorizing download of the packages you will see them appear in the `nuget` directory. You will then be able to compile the project(s).
